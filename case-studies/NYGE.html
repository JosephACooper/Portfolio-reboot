      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt5">Background Information</h3>
      <h3 class="f5 black-80 ma0 mt3">THE BRIEF</h3>
      <p class="f4 mt1 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        Working with the National Youth Guitar Ensemble (NYGE) was part of university branding module. In this module real clients are invited in for us to work with. For this project I worked in a group with 3 other people and I led the research and web design parts of this project.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f5 black-80 ma0 mt4">WHO ARE NYGE?</h3>
      <p class="f4 mt1 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto pb5 bb">NYGE provide talented classical guitarists between the age of 12-24 to meet each other and play together in an ensemble environment (an environment which isn’t typically associated with classical guitar) as well as providing coaching from industry leaders. NYGE does this by hosting monthly meet-ups for there members. They also host a summer camp which is open to all levels of guitar players.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt5">Research</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        Before beginning the project we wanted to get to know the client, figure out what is they do and discover if there are currently any major problems with the current brand. To do this we spent the day with the client at one of their monthly get togethers in London. During this visit we got to hear the ensembles play, ask questions and hand out some questionnaires to current members of NYGE. Below you can see some of the results from the questionnaire.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-survey.png" srcset="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-survey.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="Examples of questions asked and the results">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb4">Here is a selection of some of the questions we asked the members in the London group</p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        After the results were but into a graph I analysed them thoroughly to see where we could help improve NYGE and also highlight elements we can use to help promote the organisation.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        The survey we conducted allowed us to pinpoint a typical user journey that potential new members will take when applying to be a part of NYGE. The basic user journey consists of a guitar player getting told to look into joining NYGE by their guitar teacher, the player will then look up NYGE online and after being convinced that joining is the right thing to do they would tell their parents about the opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        This user journey not only allowed us to form more accurate user personas but also allowed can be enhanced with the new identity. One of the touch points we decided to focus primarily on was the website.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt5">Goals</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        The research that we conducted allowed us to produce a set of goals and values that would be used to help guide the direction of the brand identity. These were:
      </p>
      <ol class="black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto f4 w-90">
        <li class="mb3 pl3">Communicate youth and vibrancy</li>
        <li class="mb3 pl3">Create a sense of community and belonging</li>
        <li class="mb3 pl3">Represent excellency and passion</li>
          <li class="mb3 pl3">To be recognised nationwide by being viewed alongside other national youth programmes like the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britian.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt5">The New Identity</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        After pitching many different logo variants to each other and our lecturers we settled on the version you can see below. This was one of the concepts that I had come up with. The logo represents the mentioned goals and values by creating an abstract composition of the plectrum, achieved with coloured lines. These lines can be interpreted as sound waves emanating from a guitar, crossing each other to convey the dynamics of sound. The enclosed shape helps create a sense of community. The logo is flexible and can be adapted to work just as a shape, text and even letters.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-logo.png" srcset="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-logo.png 2x" class="w-100 mt4 shadow-4" alt="The proposed NYGE logo">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb4">Here you can see the logo that we proposed to the client.</p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        The logo also uses the typeface Fislon Pro. In order to keep NYGEs branding consistent, this typeface is used throughout the majority of the brand material. The reason for choosing this typeface is because some of the characters have little quirky and fun features while still be extremely readable.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt5">Web Design</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        As established in our research and questionnaires the website is one of the key touch points when on-boarding new members. Therefore we created a new website to go along side the rebrand in order to appeal more to new members and also the general public.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        The design of the website is consistent with the overall brand identity as it uses Filson Pro as the primary typeface alongside using the illustration style that we have proposed. The site also now features an audition page which is strongly linked to a campaign that we came up with to help promote NYGE. This campaign involved people applying to become a member of NYGE by uploading audition clips on to social media.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        As mobile phones are now being used more and more browsing the internet I decided to design the website for mobile first. This mobile first design approach is also appropriate as the target audience for NYGE is 12-24 year olds, an age range who have been brought up using phones for daily tasks like browsing the internet.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-mobile.png" srcset="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-mobile.png 2x" class="w-100 mt4 shadow-4" alt="Image of the proposed NYGE website">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb4">Here is what the proposed website would like on mobile devices. After I had designed the mobile view I took the assets and adapted them to the web</p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        The design of the site has been streamlined in order to make the website easy to navigate and make the key information about the brand much more accessible. For example the current NYGE website has links in it’s navigation bar which the majority of users don’t need to see straight away (such as the policies). To combat this these links have been moved to the footer of the site.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-home.png" srcset="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-home.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="Desktop view of the NYGE homescreen">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb3">This is the homescreen which has been adapted to desktop devices. Here you can see I have added an upcoming events section. This should section should help raise more awareness to NYGE concerts, something which the current lacks.</p>

      <img src="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-audition.png" srcset="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-audition.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="Desktop view of the NYGE homescreen">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb3">The audition page ties in with the campaign we created. The campaign encourages people to send in video clips of them playing the guitar, doing so gives them the opportunity to win an audition. As well as winning the audition they will also be promoted on this page.</p>

      <img src="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-store.png" srcset="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-store.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="Desktop view of the NYGE audition page">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb3">I also created a store section for the site. This would help the charity bring in more money as well as providing memorabilia to NYGE members or people who visit concerts.</p>

      <img src="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-contact.png" srcset="../img/case-NYGE/nyge-contact.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="Desktop view of the NYGE contact page">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb5">This is a simple contact form for people who may have any questions. In our brand guidelines we came up with a tone of voice which NYGE should use, this tone of voice has been applied to the contact form to make it feel more personal.</p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt4">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto pb5 bb">
        Overall I think we produced a successful brand identity and several application to go along side it which should appeal the target audiences NYGE wants to attract. However if given more time I would have still liked to explore how we could have adapted some of our other logo solutions into a full brand toolkit and analyse the success’ and failures of each approach. I would have also have liked to have interviewed/surveyed a larger sample of members, as NYGE has several bases around the UK, as well as parents and people who attend NYGE events.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f4 black ma0 mt5">TL;DR</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 mb2 fw1 lh-copy pb6 calisto">
        As part of a university module I worked in a group to rebrand the National Youth Guitar Ensemble.  As a group we also decided to go forward with my design direction for the overall brand identity.  I also lead the web design and research parts of the project.
