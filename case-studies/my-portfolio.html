      <h1 class="animated fadeInUp f2 mt4 mb2 black">The Portfolio Sprint</h1>
      <h2 class="animated fadeInUp f3 mt2 mb4 fw1 black-50">The process of designing my portfolio</h2>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">To me portfolios are an important part of being a designer, they’re needed in order to show off work and ultimately to help get clients and jobs. I didn’t have one, and I needed one. As I’m confident with web development I decided I would sit down one weekend and finally get one up and running.
      </p>
      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">I also decided that I would document the process of me building the portfolio. There are several reasons for this: to show people how I think when it comes to designing, to analyse my own process, to learn from this and then to ultimately improve as a designer for my next project.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt4">Goals</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        When I start a project I often write down a list of goals that I want to achieve. Writing down this list helps me identify some key issues I wish to tackle as well as outlining a set of objectives for the finished product.
      </p>
      <ol class="black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto f4 w-90">
        <li class="mb3 pl3"><strong class="fw6 i">Mobile first design:</strong> mobile traffic is always growing, some recent research showed that for the first time mobile traffic had overtaken desktop/laptop traffic for the first time. This is not the only reason to start with designing for mobile, Google also favours search results for mobile friendly websites and it also drives me to focus on content and user experience due to the small screen sizes and limitations.</li>
        <li class="mb3 pl3"><strong class="fw6 i">Simplicity:</strong> the site needs to be simple. Being simple allows the user to gain all the information they need to know without having to spend to long navigating around the site.</li>
        <li class="mb3 pl3"><strong class="fw6 i">Visual:</strong> strong use of visuals throughout the site can hopefully help keep people on the site as they add an extra layer of interest. Not only this but strong use of visuals can help people scan through the website quickly in order to extract key pieces of information</li>
        <li class="mb3 pl3"><strong class="fw6 i">Case studies:</strong> case studies are a great way of showcasing to people how you think through problems. These are great for numerous reasons, they encourage people to come to your site and see how you work, they’re nice to have for future employees to see and they’re also handy for just reflecting back on what you have done. I want case studies to be one of the main draw points of the site.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt4">Research</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">
        As with all projects it is important to research what exists out there. I spent ages browsing portfolios and analysing what I like about certain portfolios and what I think could be improved about them. If you’re looking for a list of some good portfolios check out this article <a href="https://blog.cortes.us/giant-list-of-design-inspiration-to-use" class="dim red">here</a> by my friend <a href="https://cortes.us" class="dim red">Dennis Cortes</a> and also this list <a href="https://spectrum.chat/?t=bf114297-6ff3-4ec4-be3e-34b3e7498c31" class="dim red">here</a> by <a href="http://www.brianlovin.com/" class="dim red">Brian Lovin</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">I was also lucky enough to get the chance to speak to <a href="https://dribbble.com/EvanKnight" class="dim red">Evan Knight</a> through the <a href="https://www.outofofficehours.com/" class="dim red">Out of Office Hours</a> scheme. I was talking to Evan about creating a portfolio and mentioned a “10 second and 10 minute rule” which your portfolio should pass. The basic idea behind this is that your site should be able to provide someone with all the information they may need or want in 10 seconds but also aim to try and keep the user on the site for up to 10 minutes with in depth case studies and call to actions. This makes a lot of sense as you don’t want potential employees/connections navigating around your site for ages figuring out how to contact you or follow you on social platforms.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">Although this is not necessarily as important at this stage I began to research what CSS framework I wanted to use. The reason for this is I wanted to stay away from bootstrap; I knew bootstrap reasonably well and I wanted to push myself to learn something new, I also found that bootstrap sites often look very similar due to all the pre-made components in it, and customising these components was often a pain. After hours of browsing around and playing with multiple frameworks I stumbled across <a href="https://www.outofofficehours.com/" class="dim red">Tachyons</a> by <a href="http://mrmrs.cc/" class="dim red">mrmrs</a>, but I will cover this more later.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt4">Design</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">As stated in my goals I want my website to be built mobile first. So I opened up Sketch and created a series of basic wireframes starting with a mobile sized art-board and working my up towards a Desktop size. Throughout this stage I was keeping the “10 second and 10 minute rule” in mind order to help create a visual hierarchy which was interesting and also a UX which was easy to gather important information about me from. These wireframes would then be the basic skeleton for which my designs would be based on.
      </p>

      <img src="../img/case-port/Wireframes.png" srcset="../img/case-port/Wireframes.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="quick wireframes looking at potetnial ways of displaying case studies">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb4">Here you can see some quick wireframes looking at potetnial ways of displaying case studies</p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">Here is where things started to get slightly more interesting. I don’t have a developed personal brand yet, so this meant I have no colour palette or existing materials. This is something I wanted to begin fixing. I spent more time than I probably should looking around for colour inspiration and creating combinations until I was happy. After playing around with my two favourite colour ways I decided to get some opinions on which colour scheme people preferred. Unfortunately the opinions were pretty 50/50 which made this choosing which way to go forward slightly more difficult. In the end I actually settled for a very basic palette.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">After deciding on the the colour way I experimented with several ways of showcasing work, the options here were either using cards or using a list. I kept experimenting with this throughout the development process and in the end I settled on what you can currently see on the home page - which I guess is kind of a hybrid approach. Below you can see some alternatives I came up with, I decided against them though as they weren’t really working too well across all the different screen sizes.
      </p>

      <img src="../img/case-port/card-options.png" srcset="../img/case-port/card-options.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="potential routes for cards to display case studies">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb4">These are some of the directions I explored which could be used as cards for the case studies</p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">When the homepage was created I jumped into Atom and started coding everything up. At this point my design process changes slightly as I’m constantly jumping back and forward between code and design and even going back to basic research. For example developing the case study pages meant researching what platforms like Medium do in regards to line length and type size, applying design based on the research and then coding it up. Below you can see the final sketch artboard I had as I was finishing up the design of the site.
      </p>

      <img src="../img/case-port/website-sketch.png" srcset="../img/case-port/website-sketch.png 2x" class="w-100 mt3 shadow-4" alt="potential routes for cards to display case studies">
      <p class="f5 i black-60 calisto mt2 mb4">This was my final artboard in sketch after I was happy with the direction of the design. Pretty similar to the final outcome!</p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">As much as designers love the idea of having some kind of rigorous design process although I find it is often not feasible as you often end up jumping between the various stages.
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt4">Code</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">I’ll start of by saying I am no expert at front-end development but I do have confident knowledge of HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">As I mentioned earlier I wanted to build my site on top of Tachyons. Tachyons is a CSS framework but it has a different approach to your typical frameworks, the way it works is kind of similar to inline styling (this may sound hideous but trust me take a look at the site and give it a go). On top of this Tachyons is mobile first and also built on top of an excellent typographic and scaling system. With Tachyons I was able to build this whole site with less 40 lines of additional CSS. Tachyons is definitely something I will be using in future web projects.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">Another tool I used for the first time was BrowserSync, this is also something I will definitely be using in my workflow in the future. In case you didn’t know BrowserSync live reloads your webpages every time you make a change, saving me pressing “cmd + R” every-time I want to preview the site in browser. It also allowed me to preview my site extremely easily on mobiles and tablets so I didn’t have to play around with Inspect element.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto">After the majority of the website was developed I decided to add in some final touches through the use of animations. I wanted these anitmations to be quick and not get in the way too much. Some of these aniations were custom made and some have come from <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" class="dim red">animate.css</a>
      </p>

      <h3 class="f3 black ma0 mt4">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto">Overall I am very happy with the result considering the whole process took just under one week. There are a few things I would like to change. I already have new ideas for a redesign and also after hearing several things about react and then watching Dennis Cortes (I really recommend you follow him) build his site using it I definitely want to look to using next time.
      </p>

      <p class="f4 mb2 black-80 fw1 lh-copy calisto pb5 bb">Although I am not completely happy with the outcome — for the time being the sites serves its purpose well and meets the criteria I set out to achieve.</p>


      <h3 class="f4 black ma0 mt5">TL;DR</h3>
      <p class="f4 black-80 ma0 mt2 fw1 lh-copy calisto mb6">I designed and developed the website you’re currently looking at over the space of a week in order to get my name and work out there. The website was built with the help of CSS framework Tachyons.
